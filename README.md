# Sensors
Provides an intelligent router as an overlay network using I2P for a base level of anonymity P2P and Tor when accessing clearnet web services. 
The module participates with the DID Service for self-sovereign identity and reputation based access. 
The system survives even if the internet goes down or is cut off by supporting peer-to-peer direct wireless mesh networks. 
As long as enough people still have their device, the network survives.
